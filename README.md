<h1>Intrusion Detection System using Convolutional Neural Networks</h1>

<p>This project seeks to find out the performance and efficiency of CNN models in the detection of cyber attacks.</p>

<p>Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) is designed to mimic the
human visual system (HVS). It is made up of several neurons with learning weights and
biases. CNN accepts a large number of inputs and takes the weighted sum of those inputs
and sends them to the activation function to give output.<p/>

<p> Due to the lack of reliable test and validation datasets, anomaly-based intrusion detection 
approaches are suffering from consistent and accurate performance evolutions. This dataset was 
originally created by the University of New Brunswick for analyzing DDoS data. he dataset itself
was based on logs of the university's servers, which found various DoS attacks throughout the publicly
available period. In total, there are eighty columns within this dataset, each of which corresponds 
to an entry in the IDS logging system that the Unversity of New Brunswick has in place.<p/>
